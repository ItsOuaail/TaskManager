# NGINX CONFIGURATION EXPLAINED:
# 
# This configures nginx to serve the React SPA (Single Page Application)
# 
# Key settings:
# - listen 80: Serve on port 80
# - root: Where the built files are located
# - try_files: For React Router - all routes go to index.html
# - gzip: Compress responses for faster loading
# - cache: Static assets cached for 1 year
# - security headers: Basic security hardening
# 
# Why try_files $uri $uri/ /index.html?
# - React Router handles routing in the browser
# - All unknown paths should load index.html
# - Then React Router takes over
